# Globus Data Transfer Guide at TACC
*Last update: March 05, 2026*

Globus is the preferred, safest, and fastest way to move very large datasets to and from TACC systems.  Globus minimizes user effort while maximizing throughput and reliability, especially over long‑distance or unstable networks.  TACC User Support recommends Globus for transferring very large datasets (e.g. 200 GB to many PB) to and from TACC and other research computing facilities. 

For datasets &lt; 200GB, see the [TACC SSH-based Tools Guide](datatransfer_ssh.md). 

## Key Concepts

### Endpoints

A Globus transfer always occurs between two endpoints:

- A TACC system endpoint (e.g., Stampede, Frontera, Lonestar)
- A source endpoint (your laptop, another HPC center, cloud storage, etc.)

Endpoints may be:

- **Managed endpoints** (TACC systems, institutional servers)
- **Globus Connect Personal (GCP) endpoints** (your laptop or desktop)

### Paths

Transfers use **absolute paths** on each endpoint:
- Example TACC paths:  
  `/scratch/`, `/work/`, `/corral/`, or resource‑specific directories

You must have permission to read/write the paths specified..

  
## Using Globus

Globus uses **federated login**, where you authenticate with your home institution. Authentication tokens are cached and renewed automatically.

This document walks you through the steps required to set up access to Globus at TACC for first-time use. Some steps must be repeated each time you configure a new data endpoint. Once configured, Globus can be used not only for transfers to and from TACC, but also to access cyberinfrastructure resources worldwide.

To start using Globus, you need to do two things: Generate a unique identifier, or **ePPN**, for all Globus services, and enroll the machine you are transferring data to/from with Globus.  This can be your personal laptop or desktop, or a server to which you have access. Follow this one-time process to set up the Globus file transfer capability.


!!! important 
	You must use your institution's credentials and **not your personal email account (e.g. Google, Yahoo!, AOL)** when setting up Globus.  You will encounter problems with the transfer endpoints (e.g. Frontera, Stampede3, Corral, Ranch) if you use your personal account information.


### Step 1. **Retrieve your Unique ePPN**.  { #step1 }

Login to [CILogon](https://cilogon.org) and click on "User Attributes".  Make note of your **case-sensitive** ePPN.

### Step 2. **Associate your ePPN with your TACC Account.**  { #step2 }

Login to the [TACC Accounts Portal][TACCACCOUNTS], click "Account Information" in the left-hand menu, then add or edit your ePPN from Step 1.

!!! warning
	The institution (ePPN) listed in your [TACC account profile](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/account_info) must match the ePPN you are using to log into Globus.

!!! important
	Once you update your ePPN, please allow up to 2 hours for the changes to propagate across TACC systems.


### Using the Globus File Manager (Web Interface)

Once you've completed these steps, you will be able to use the [Globus File Manager](https://app.globus.org) as usual.  If you encounter any issues, please [submit a support ticket][SUBMITTICKET].

Globus-based transfers often utilize an endpoint name (often the name of the HPC or Storage resource you are connecting to) rather than a hostname, but you will still need to know the endpoint name, and you will always need the PATH that you are addressing, in order to successfully transfer data.

1. Go to: [https://app.globus.org](https://app.globus.org)
2. Activate the source endpoint
3. Activate the destination endpoint
4. Select source files/directories
5. Select destination path
6. Click **Start**

Transfers run **asynchronously** — you may close your browser.

### Recommended Practices

- Transfer files into **scratch or work**, not your home directory, unless required
- Group many small files into tar archives if possible
- Verify quotas and permissions before starting large transfers
- Avoid transferring directly into running job directories

### Monitoring Transfers

- Progress is visible in the Globus web UI
- Email notifications can be enabled
- Failed file transfers are clearly reported

### Performance Expectations

Note that SSH-based transfers perform poorly on **high-latency network paths**. For large data transfers (e.g. > 200 GB) over paths with round-trip times (RTT) greater than ~10 ms (e.g. outside Texas), Globus is strongly recommended. In these environments, Globus is often **orders of magnitude faster** than `scp`, frequently achieving **100× or greater throughput improvements**.

If you want to compare your data transfer performance to others, you can use the [TACC NetSage Portal](https://tacc.netsage.io/). For example [this page](https://tacc.netsage.io/grafana/d/-l3_u8nWl/1b22d62) shows transfer rates for Globus jobs between TACC and the rest of the world. In general, you should be able to get at least 1 Gbps transfer speeds.

### Using the Globus CLI (Advanced)

If you currently use a shell script / cron job to migrate data using scp/sftp/rsync, the Globus CLI is useful for scripting and automation.

See our [Globus CLI Guide](datatransfer_globus_cli.md) for a short summary of using the Globus CLI.

### A Note on End-to-End Checksums

Globus also provides **end-to-end file-level checksum verification by default**, which is critical for ensuring data integrity during large transfers. SSH-based tools report transfer success based on transport-layer completion but **do not verify file content equivalence** at the source and destination. Unlike Globus, `scp` lacks built-in checksum verification and robust resume capabilities, making it unsuitable for validating large or irreplaceable datasets without manual checksum comparison (e.g., MD5 or SHA-256). File-level checksums act as a digital fingerprint of file content. Comparing checksums before and after transfer ensures that data arrives intact and protects against silent data corruption introduced during disk I/O, staging, or wide-area network transfer.
